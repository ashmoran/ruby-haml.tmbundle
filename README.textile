h2. Description

This bundle originated as a port of the "official Ruby Haml.tmbundle":http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/Ruby%20Haml.tmbundle/.

Since a co-worker and I noticed that the plugin was mostly stagnant, we decided to try and update it to become slightly more 
useful.  I hope that you find this helpful in your day to day Haml workflow.  Please let me know how you like it and contribute 
if you can!

Installation

  1. cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
